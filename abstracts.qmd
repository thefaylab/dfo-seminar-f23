#### ***Socio-ecological dynamics of fisheries in the face of extreme events***

Extreme events are, by definition, rare, but they can have significant consequences for systems. This is especially the case in socio-ecological systems that involve linkages between several-subsystems, allowing to the effects of an extreme event to propagate. In this talk, I'll highlight studies focused on how extreme events affect the socio-ecological dynamics of fisheries. The talk will contain case studies on coral reef fisheries, COVID-19 and seafood, and recreational fisheries. I'll show that shock events can dramatically alter the course of the socio-ecological system and change management recommendations. I identify counter-intuitive situations where the degradation of habitat via a shock event can help the system persist in a healthy state as a result of feedback from the social dynamics.

Dr. Easton White is a quantitative marine ecologist who uses mathematical and statistical tools, coupled with experiments and field observations, to answer questions in ecology, conservation science, sustainability, and ecosystem management. Most of his work is focused on marine systems, especially fisheries and spatial planning. Easton currently conducts research on assessing the effectiveness of protected area networks, improving species monitoring programs, and modeling socio-ecological systems in the context of fisheries. His work centers on how environmental variability, in particular rare events (e.g., hurricanes, COVID-19 pandemic), affects ecosystems and those that depend on them. He is currently recruiting for graduate students within the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab at the University of New Hampshire working with Professor Easton White.

#### ***Legacies of stress: eco-evolutionary consequences of transgenerational and carryover effects in coastal systems***

Phenotypic plasticity is a critical component of organismal responses to environmental change. My seminar will focus on a central theme of my research program -- \"legacy effects,\" or how past environmental experiences shape organism phenotypes, the mechanisms of these changes, and the consequences of these changes for communities and ecosystems. We will explore how parental experience with predators influences fitness and physiology in intertidal snails and how early life exposure to climate change stressors impacts oyster growth and nitrogen storage, a critical ecosystem service.

Dr. Sarah Donelan\'s research focuses on how marine organisms respond to stress across generations and life stages. She works primarily with marine invertebrates like snails and oysters found along the coast of Massachusetts and explores stressors that affect many coastal organisms, including those associated with climate change, predation, and species invasions. She began as an Assistant Professor at UMass Dartmouth in Fall 2023. Prior to UMassD, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Maryland. She received her Ph.D. in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology from Northeastern University and her B.A. in Biology from Wesleyan University. In her downtime, she enjoys spending time outdoors with her husband and infant daughter, cycling, watching Survivor, and tending to her many houseplants.
