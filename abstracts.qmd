#### ***Socio-ecological dynamics of fisheries in the face of extreme events***

Extreme events are, by definition, rare, but they can have significant consequences for systems. This is especially the case in socio-ecological systems that involve linkages between several-subsystems, allowing to the effects of an extreme event to propagate. In this talk, I'll highlight studies focused on how extreme events affect the socio-ecological dynamics of fisheries. The talk will contain case studies on coral reef fisheries, COVID-19 and seafood, and recreational fisheries. I'll show that shock events can dramatically alter the course of the socio-ecological system and change management recommendations. I identify counter-intuitive situations where the degradation of habitat via a shock event can help the system persist in a healthy state as a result of feedback from the social dynamics.

Dr. Easton White is a quantitative marine ecologist who uses mathematical and statistical tools, coupled with experiments and field observations, to answer questions in ecology, conservation science, sustainability, and ecosystem management. Most of his work is focused on marine systems, especially fisheries and spatial planning. Easton currently conducts research on assessing the effectiveness of protected area networks, improving species monitoring programs, and modeling socio-ecological systems in the context of fisheries. His work centers on how environmental variability, in particular rare events (e.g., hurricanes, COVID-19 pandemic), affects ecosystems and those that depend on them. He is currently recruiting for graduate students within the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab at the University of New Hampshire working with Professor Easton White.

#### *Building a Climate-Ready Northeast U.S. Atlantis Ecosystem Model*

With increased concern on the impacts of climate change on the northeast U.S., there is a growing need for modelling products that can relate large-scale environmental change to regional and local processes. End-to-end ecosystem models, like Atlantis, simulate ecosystem-wide processes from physics and biogeochemistry, to ecological processes and population dynamics, all through socioeconomic impacts. The Northeast U.S. Atlantis ecosystem model (NEUSv2) is such a model, and while much of its development has focused on its ability to reproduce critical ecosystem processes and validated against data, it\'s not yet \"climate-ready\". This talk will discuss the development workflow and modeling efforts of NEUSv2, some broader observations on the tradeoffs between model skill, complexity, and resources, as well as some current work to improve NEUSv2\'s ability to relate global climate change to regional/local impacts.

Dr. Joe Caracappa is a life-long resident of the northeast U.S. After growing up in rural NH, he received his undergraduate at Boston College. Later he received his PhD at Rutgers University studying the effects of larval morphology and behavior on population connectivity and dispersal. Joe then worked as a post-doctoral researcher with the National Research Council at NOAA\'s Northeast Fisheries Science Center to work on the development of its regional Atlantis ecosystem model. He has now continued as a contractor at the NEFSC working towards the operationalization of the NEUSv2 Atlantis model.

#### *Exploring population connectivity in winter flounder*

The expression of alternative life-history strategies can be advantageous for a species that experiences fluctuating environmental conditions. Intra-species differences in migration propensity and the timing of spawning create diverse population components which can respond plastically to environmental variability, promoting long-term stability within the population. However, such intra-specific diversity can also lead to challenges for the assessment and management of harvested species when we can no longer assume that stocks with such diverse subcomponents have homogeneous population dynamics. A concern for the assessment and management of Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic winter flounder (*Pseudopleuronectes americanus*) is whether diversity in migration propensity and the timing and location of spawning results in persistent stock structure. We characterized intra-specific behavioral diversity in migration propensity for winter flounder across multiple spatial scales. The migration propensity and natal origin for individual flounder were cross-referenced with their genotype, allowing us to compare genetic signatures of population structure with migration and spawning behavior. Including the role of behavior in mediating population connectivity will lead to more accurate interpretation of the causes and consequences of changes in fisheries productivity, and thus help us design more accurate assessment and effective management strategies.

#### ***Legacies of stress: eco-evolutionary consequences of transgenerational and carryover effects in coastal systems***

Phenotypic plasticity is a critical component of organismal responses to environmental change. My seminar will focus on a central theme of my research program -- "legacy effects," or how past environmental experiences shape organism phenotypes, the mechanisms of these changes, and the consequences of these changes for communities and ecosystems. We will explore how parental experience with predators influences fitness and physiology in intertidal snails and how early life exposure to climate change stressors impacts oyster growth and nitrogen storage, a critical ecosystem service.

Dr. Sarah Donelan's research focuses on how marine organisms respond to stress across generations and life stages. She works primarily with marine invertebrates like snails and oysters found along the coast of Massachusetts and explores stressors that affect many coastal organisms, including those associated with climate change, predation, and species invasions. She began as an Assistant Professor at UMass Dartmouth in Fall 2023. Prior to UMassD, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Maryland. She received her Ph.D. in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology from Northeastern University and her B.A. in Biology from Wesleyan University. In her downtime, she enjoys spending time outdoors with her husband and infant daughter, cycling, watching Survivor, and tending to her many houseplants.
