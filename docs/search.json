    "text": "Socio-ecological dynamics of fisheries in the face of extreme events\nExtreme events are, by definition, rare, but they can have significant consequences for systems. This is especially the case in socio-ecological systems that involve linkages between several-subsystems, allowing to the effects of an extreme event to propagate. In this talk, I’ll highlight studies focused on how extreme events affect the socio-ecological dynamics of fisheries. The talk will contain case studies on coral reef fisheries, COVID-19 and seafood, and recreational fisheries. I’ll show that shock events can dramatically alter the course of the socio-ecological system and change management recommendations. I identify counter-intuitive situations where the degradation of habitat via a shock event can help the system persist in a healthy state as a result of feedback from the social dynamics.\nDr. Easton White is a quantitative marine ecologist who uses mathematical and statistical tools, coupled with experiments and field observations, to answer questions in ecology, conservation science, sustainability, and ecosystem management. Most of his work is focused on marine systems, especially fisheries and spatial planning. Easton currently conducts research on assessing the effectiveness of protected area networks, improving species monitoring programs, and modeling socio-ecological systems in the context of fisheries. His work centers on how environmental variability, in particular rare events (e.g., hurricanes, COVID-19 pandemic), affects ecosystems and those that depend on them. He is currently recruiting for graduate students within the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab at the University of New Hampshire working with Professor Easton White.
